* Introduction
The Gaussian Functions remain one of the keystones of computational chemistry due to the computational properties.
The general form of the 1-dimensional Gaussian Function is
\begin{equation}
G(\alpha,x,A,B,n) = (x-A)^n\exp(-\alpha(x-B)^2),
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$ is a parameter that controls the /sharpness/ of the function, $A$ controls
the centering of the nodes, $B$ controls the centering of the middle of the function, and
$n$ controls the /order/ of the function. Typically, $A=B$ but these may be varied if desired.
* Cusp Condition
While Gaussian Functions do not satisfy the needed cusp condition:
